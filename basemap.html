            <h2>About Me:</h2>

            <p>I am Kevin. I make things. Pretty things. Things like oh, i dunno....sometimes some paintings, other times a little bit of music. Sometimes I even make music with other humans. Crazy, I know. Recently things done by me is this fancy website your reading (so fancy it hurts to comprehend the glory of it all, I get that. It's okay if you need a few moments to collect yourself before looking at the other also amazing sections). I'm also in the know, on the level, hip to the vibe and I always know what it is and wehre it's at. .... but I do get lost easily...
            <br><br>
            The best path in life is a wandering one through a nice garden. Along the way I have explored and grown as a comic book artists, traditional media artist, illustrator, Piano playing drummer-typer percussionist,hortculturalist & arborist, team leader, training officer, supervisor, a graduated-psychology undergrad, digitil composition, digital design and content creation, building hackintosh machines, ripping apart any other kind of machine, breaking and then fixing my rigs, fully owning the OS X world and doing a fairly good job kicking the tires of the PC & Linux worlds. 
            <br><br>
            Check back here in a while, don't rush it, good art takes time and afterall I am an artist. You can't rush us, we just throw stuff at you until you move on and continue as we were.
